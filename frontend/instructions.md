# Frontend

Recreate the image found in ui.png with just HTML and CSS. Using any libraries or css frameworks like bootstrap is not allowed.

Feel free to source for icons and images needed to recreate the image. The design does not need to be an exact replica. We are looking at how you position the components. Responsiveness is also not a priority, a regular desktop view design is good enough for this task.
